[PlantwisePlus Dashboard](https://ndcdashboard.000webhostapp.com/) is a dashboard design for National Data Center of PlantwisePlus situated in Karachi, Pakistan. It is a Bootstrap Admin dashborad with a fresh, new design inspired by Google's Material Design. We are very excited to introduce our take on the data concepts through an easy to use and beautiful set of components. PlantwisePlus Dashboard was built over the popular Bootstrap framework and it comes with a couple of third-party plugins redesigned to fit in with the rest of the elements.

[PlantwisePlus Dashboard makes use of light, surface and movement. The general layout resembles sheets of paper following multiple different layers, so that the depth and order is obvious. The navigation stays mainly on the left sidebar and the content is on the right inside the main panel.

This product came as a result of users asking for a dashboard for DATA center. I developed it based on user feedback and it is a powerful bootstrap admin dashboard, which allows you to build products like admin panels, content managements systems and CRMs.
